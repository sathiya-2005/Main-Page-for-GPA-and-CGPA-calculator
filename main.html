				of a student's academic performance based on the grades they have
				achieved in their courses.<br />

				‣ GPA is typically calculated on a scale of 0 to 10.0 in the Indian
				education system, with 10.0 being the highest possible GPA. The GPA
				scale may vary in different countries.<br />

				‣ Here is a simple formula to calculate GPA:<br />

				‣ Assign a numerical value to each letter grade. For example:<br />

				S = 10.0<br />
				A = 9.0<br />
				B = 8.0<br />
				C = 7.0<br />
				D = 6.0<br />
				F = 5.0<br />
				‣ Multiply the numerical value of each grade by the number of credits
				for the course.<br />

				‣ Add up all the resulting values for each course.<br />

				‣ Divide the total value by the total number of credits taken. This will
				give you the GPA.<br>

			<h2>What is CGPA?</h2>
			<p>
				‣ CGPA, which stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average, is a crucial measure of a student's academic performance throughout their academic journey. When considering a grading scale of 10, the highest achievable grade, often a S, would be associated with the highest point value, such as 10. As the grades decrease, the corresponding point values also decrease.<br>

                ‣ The CGPA is calculated by averaging the accumulated points earned in all subjects or courses and then scaling it to fit within the 10-point scale. This provides a comprehensive representation of a student's academic performance over time.<br>

                ‣ CGPA offers a standardized way to measure and compare academic performance across different students, classes, and schools. It's a crucial metric for students, teachers, and institutions to understand a student's overall academic standing.<br>

                ‣ Understanding the CGPA on a 10-point scale is essential for both students and educational institutions, providing a holistic view of academic achievement. If you're aiming for a clear understanding of your academic journey, the CGPA is a key indicator to focus on.
